 # Euclidean Rhythms
 ### When Rhythm meets Math.
 
 If you're a Boards of Canada fan like me, the sentence **"Music is Math"** is already well-known to you. But besides being the name of a very enjoyable tune *(go listen to it if you don't know it already!)*, it also holds true by itself. Math surrounds us everywhere, and it shouldn't be surprising that it also plays a vital role in Music.
