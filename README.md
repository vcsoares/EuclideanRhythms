# Euclidean Rhythms
WWDC 2019 Scholarship winning Swift Playground for teaching the concept of Euclidean Rhythms.

## Goal
This Playground application was designed to help teach Euclidean Rhythms with an easier, more visual and hands-on approach.

There are 3 pages with bite-sized, simple explanations about what these rhythms are, and in each page there's a live view that lets you listen to and visualize the concepts discussed in them, complete with examples for you to try out.

Additionally, the last page gives you 3 different controls, each one loaded with a different drum sample, so you can get to build your own drum beat using Euclidean Rhythms.
